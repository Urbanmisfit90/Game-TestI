# Tauri + React

Tauri Rust Application

This project demonstrates a simple Tauri application written in Rust. It defines a function named greet that takes a name as input and returns a formatted greeting message. The application leverages Tauri to expose this function for use from the frontend.

Requirements

Rust compiler (>=1.56)
Cargo package manager (included with Rust)
Node.js (>=14.18.0)
Getting Started

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tauri-rust-app.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd tauri-rust-app

Install dependencies:
cargo install --locked --path .

Build and run the application:
cargo run

This will start the Tauri development server and open the application in your default web browser.

Explanation

src-tauri/src/main.rs: This file contains the Rust code for the application. It defines the greet function and sets up the Tauri server to expose this function.
src-tauri/.gitignore: This file specifies files that should be ignored by Git version control.
Cargo.lock: This file locks down the specific versions of dependencies used by the project to ensure reproducibility.
Frontend Integration

(Assuming a Javascript frontend)

This is a basic example. You can extend this project by:

Implementing additional functionality in Rust and exposing it to the frontend.
Building a more complex user interface using your preferred frontend framework.
